# Minesweeper

This Game is inspired by the original Windows Version.


### How to run:
There are two ways to run the Application: From IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) or to install an actual Java Runtime Environment.


#### Instruction for IDE (e.g. IntelliJ):
1. Clone the file to your directory.
2. Go to the build.gradle file in your IDE.
3. Try to build the project, if it fails follow the steps bellow.
4. Look in the top left corner and click on "Download coretto-17.0.2".
5. Wait until the JDK has been installed.
6. Run App.java to test the Application


#### Prerequisites for installing the release:
- Java Runtime Environment


### The Field:
Choose between three different difficulties:

Easy - 15 x 10 Raster & 15% Bombs
Medium - 20 x 15 Raster & 18% Bombs
Hard - 25 x 20 Raster & 20% Bombs


### How to play:
The game is usually over when a mine is revealed.

The game continues when an empty square is revealed.

If a number is displayed when a square is uncovered,
it represents the number of mines, that are hidden in the adjacent 8 fields.

Based on this information, it can be deduced under which of the adjacent fields mines are located,
and on which fields can be clicked without danger.

Have fun! :)
